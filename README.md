simplebenchmark
===============

What does this class do?

Records how many milliseconds have transpired and how much memory has been consumed between 'markers' you put in your code wherever you want.
Output results in a few different formats.

What does this class not do?

Tracing, profiling or watching. For that, I recommend XDebug.

Why would I use this class and not XDebug or something else?

This class was developed for those cases where you just want to know the basic time and memory consumption of some PHP code
without the hassle of installing server software and configurations.

See the index.php for example usage.
